# Coding-Game

## Theme 
"How to make a video game" by the famous youtube channel Brackeys, covering some Unity essentials like:
* Gravity and movement
* Camera follow
* Collisions

All brought together in a low-poly environment and a well-designed interface that offers full interaction with the user's input.

##Perspectives
Create an intermediate language instead of compiling C# at runtime.
